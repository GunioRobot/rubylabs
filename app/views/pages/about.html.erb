    Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to
    create database-backed web applications according to the
    Model-View-Control pattern. 

    This pattern splits the view (also called the presentation) into “dumb”
    templates that are primarily responsible for inserting pre-built data in
    between HTML tags. The model contains the “smart” domain objects (such as
    Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all the business logic and knows
    how to persist themselves to a database. The controller handles the incoming
    requests (such as Save New Account, Update Product, Show Post) by manipulating
    the model and directing data to the view<br /><br />
