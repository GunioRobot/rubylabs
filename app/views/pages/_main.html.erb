  Active Record connects classes to relational database tables to establish an
  almost zero-configuration persistence layer for applications. The library
  provides a base class that, when subclassed, sets up a mapping between the
  new class and an existing table in the database. In context of an
  application, these classes are commonly referred to as models. Models can
  also be connected to other models; this is done by defining associations.
