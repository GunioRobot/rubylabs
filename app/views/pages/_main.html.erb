    Active Record connects classes to relational database tables to establish an
    almost zero-configuration persistence layer for applications. The library
    provides a base class that, when subclassed, sets up a mapping between the
    new class and an existing table in the database. In context of an
    application, these classes are commonly referred to as models. Models can
    also be connected to other models; this is done by defining
    associations. <br /><br />
